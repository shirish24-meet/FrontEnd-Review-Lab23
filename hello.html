	<p>
		Americanos and drip coffee have distinct tastes, because they’re prepared differently. The discrepancies in water temperature, water-to-grounds ratio, grind setting and brew time will extract flavors differently from the same coffee. In general, americanos have fuller bodies and richer tastes, but whether any individual coffee tastes better as an americano or drip coffee depends on that coffee’s origin characteristics and roast level. Some coffees make excellent espressos that create delectable americanos. Other coffees fare much better as drip brews.
